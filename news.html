    <h1>DINOSAURS FOUND ON MARS</h1>
    <h4>October 4, 2022 by Tap Vann</h4>
    <p>THERE’S  life on Mars — and it’s enormous!<br>
        NASA’s Phoenix Mars Lander has transmitted a photograph of what appears to be a super-sized dinosaur standing menacingly<br>
        on the surface of the Red Planet — and shocked scientists say the discovery has overturned “everything we thought we knew<br>
        about extra-terrestrial life.” The space agency has delayed releasing the stunning news to the public pending a full analysis<br>
        of the available data. But Dr. Simon Wycoff, an astrobiologist serving as a consultant to the Phoenix project, has agreed to<br>
        reveal what little is known about the humungous reptile and the implications of the staggering find.<br>
